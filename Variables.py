# Variables are pointers that points on object
# Variables in python are dynamic and there is no need to declare them
# since their type is defined while the program run
# each object has a defined type ( int, string, float... )

x = 'object'  # string type
y = "learner"  # string type
z = 5  # int type
w = 5.0  # float type
n = None  # NULL

type(x)  #  function that returns variable type
